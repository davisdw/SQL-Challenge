# SQL-Challenge
Module 9 SQL Challenge Assignment

==============================

Instructions
This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

Data Modeling
Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. To create the sketch, feel free to use a tool like QuickDBDLinks to an external site..

Data Engineering
Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Be sure to do the following:

  Remember to specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
  
  For the primary keys, verify that the column is unique. Otherwise, create a composite keyLinks to an external site., which takes two primary keys to uniquely identify a row.
  
  Be sure to create the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys.
  
Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.
